    <h1>Hobbies</h1>
    <h2>Outside of work I like to</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <h3><li>Experiment with Indian Cooking</li></h3>
               <p> I love cooking and experimenting with new spices, make restaurant level indian food. We can all agree there are'nt very many good Indian restaurants in this area.</p>
            <h3><li>Triathlons</li></h3>
            <p>
                I am an apsiring triathlete. I learnt how to swim at the age of 35, and it helped me with asthma. I want to continue participating in more and more triahtlons.
            </p>
            <h3><li>Learning something new</li></h3>
            <p>Learning never stops- I have outside of work taken courses in Supply Chain Management, Business Fundamentals, Python, and now learning how to make websites.</p>

            <h3><li>Meditate</li></h3>
            <p>I have been meditating on and off for the last 13 years but recently been very regular. It helps me maintain a steady state, and see the bigger picture.</p>
            <h3><li>Add More</li></h3>

            </ul>
